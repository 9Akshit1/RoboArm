# RoboArm
DESCRIPTION: RoboArm is just like how it sounds. It is a robotic arm with 3 joints that can mimic real arm movements. It uses small servo motors controlled by an EMG sensor to move based on brain signals. The hand can also be controlled manually via a computer or preset motions for easy testing and flexibility.

INSPIRATION: I've always been inspired by how human arms move and wanted to recreate that motion using motors and tendons. Additionally, I rpeviosuly buitl a RoboHand so to add on to that project, I wanted to add a RoboArm to extend it.

# Final CAD
The separate part files and body files are in ther CAD folder. The full built hand CAD File is called FULL-RoboArm.stl in the CAD folder. 

Also, please note that I can always just add supports before I 3D print, so we do not need to worry about that!

This is what the full build hand will look like. I will likely hot glue every piece together.

# Final Circuit Schematic
Schematic is called roboarm.kicad_sch in the schematic_pcb/roboarm folder.

# Final PCB
Schematic is called roboarm.kicad_pcb in the schematic_pcb/roboarm folder.

# Final Firmware Stuff
The firmware software is in the firmware folder, and are called main.py.

## Bill of Materials (BOM)

| Item                             | Quantity | Total Cost (USD) | Description / Part Number                      | Notes                                | Links                             |
|---------------------------------|----------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| | | | | | |

**BOM Cost (with 3D CAD using the average of the range which is $12.5):** $93.76 USD ≈ $130.78 CAD

**Shipping (from the links the largest shipping fee):** $5.88 USD ≈ $8 CAD 

**Subtotal:** $99.64 USD ≈ $135.54 CAD 

**Taxes (in  Ontario, Canada, it's 13%) are together:** $12.95 USD ≈ $17.62 CAD

**Total Cost:** $112.59 USD ≈ $153.16 CAD
