I worked on my CAD. I had to really think about how to design the arm. I decided to start off with some cylidners and then processeded to hollow them out, cut them, connect them, then added servo motor holders I think thsi is a good general structure, but I'll have to measure the mount position on a servo motor to exactly determine the positiosn I would put it in the real world. I also need to check how much the servo motors would be abe\le to rotate at the crrent positions.

# July 21st:
I worked on my CAD. First of all, I copy-pasted the RoboHand I made in a previous project just to see how it would look. Then, I realized the hand was too big, so I measured my own hand's fingers and dimensions in order to apply that to the CAD. I also moved everything closer so it fit together. I realized I had to add covering for every single part, so I did that, and had to adjust the dimensions of the white cylinders of the arm because I realised most of them were too big. It was difficult trying to make space for the servo motors, and probably will be even more difficult, because I realised I need to add more servo motors to the hand itself, since it needs to be able to move all the fingers very freely. 
I also realzied I need to make the right ends of the cylinders circular and then make their left endsh ave a circular cutout, so the joints can move nicely.
