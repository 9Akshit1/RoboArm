I worked on my CAD. I had to really think about how to design the arm. I decided to start off with some cylidners and then processeded to hollow them out, cut them, connect them, then added servo motor holders I think thsi is a good general structure, but I'll have to measure the mount position on a servo motor to exactly determine the positiosn I would put it in the real world. I also need to check how much the servo motors would be abe\le to rotate at the crrent positions.
