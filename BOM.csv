These are one of the best quality sensors suitable for research projects such as this and are also the cheapest deal I found everywhere! I need 6 because I'm doing a full hand-arm, meaning there are multiple muscles to look at and analyze and align and everything. Its essentially one for each DOF of the arm, however it should be ideally 1 or 2 more than this for proper accurate research and to account for the hands' muscles. However, that is outside of our budget which is why I'm only buying 6."
